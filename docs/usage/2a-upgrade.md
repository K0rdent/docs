# Upgrading 2A to the newer version

> NOTE: To upgrade 2A the user must have `Global Admin` role.
> For the detailed information about 2A RBAC, refer to the [RBAC documentation](../rbac/roles.md).

Follow the steps below to update 2A to a newer version:

**Step 1. Create a New `Release` Object**

Create a `Release` object in the management cluster for the desired version. For example, to create
a `Release` for version `v0.0.4`, run the following command:

```shell
VERSION=v0.0.4
kubectl create -f https://github.com/Mirantis/hmc/releases/download/${VERSION}/release.yaml
```

**Step 2. Update the `Management` Object with the New `Release`**

- List available `Releases`:

To view all available `Releases`, run:

```shell
kubectl get releases
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME        AGE
hmc-0-0-3   71m
hmc-0-0-4   65m
```

- Patch the `Management` Object with the New `Release` Name:

Update the `spec.release` field in the `Management` object to point to the new release. Replace `hmc-0-0-4` with
the name of your new release:

```shell
RELEASE_NAME=hmc-0-0-4
kubectl patch management.hmc hmc --patch "{\"spec\":{\"release\":\"${RELEASE_NAME}\"}}" --type=merge
```

**Step 3. Verify the Upgrade**

Check the status of the `Management` object to monitor the readiness of the components:

```shell
kubectl get management.hmc hmc -o=jsonpath={.status} | jq
```
