# Welcome to Mirantis Project 2A Docs

## Introduction

Mirantis Project 2A is focused on developing a consistent way to deploy 
and manage Kubernetes clusters at scale. Think of Project 2A as a "super 
control plane" designed to manage other Kubernetes control planes.  Whether 
you want to manage Kubernetes clusters on-premises, in the cloud, or a
combination of both, Project 2A provides a consistent way to do so.  With
full life-cycle management, including provisioning, configuration, and
maintenance, Project 2A is designed to be a repeatable and secure way 
to manage your Kubernetes clusters in a central location.

## Project 2A vs HMC

Project 2A includes all of the components below, but because HMC was the first
component to be developed, it is still referred to as "HMC" in some documentation.
In many ways "Project 2A" and "HMC" are synonymous.

2A is built around the creation of a set of standardised templates that enable 
easy, repeatable cluster deployments and life cycle management. 

The main components of 2A include:

 * **Hybrid Multi-Cluster Controller (HMC)**

    Deployment and life-cycle management of Kubernetes clusters, including configuration, updates, and other CRUD operations.

 * **State Management Controller (SMC)**

    Installation and life-cycle management of [beach-head services](glossary.md#beach-head-services), policy, Kubernetes API configurations and more.

 * **Observability (OBS)**

    Cluster and beach-head services monitoring, events and log management.

## Quick Start

See the [2A Quick Start Guide](quick-start/2a-installation.md)

## Supported Providers

Project 2A leverages the Cluster API provider ecosystem, the following providers have
had `ProviderTemplates` created and validated, and more are in the works.

 * [AWS](quick-start/aws.md)
 * [Azure](quick-start/azure.md)
 * [vSphere](quick-start/vsphere.md)
