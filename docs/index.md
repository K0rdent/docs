# Welcome to Mirantis Project 2A Docs

## Introduction

Mirantis Project 2A and is focused and developing a consistent way to deploy
and manage Kubernetes clusters at scale.

Project 2A was created to be a repeatable and secure way to leverage the existing
Kubernetes ecosystem (e.g. Cluster API) while being able to provide for the range of
unique use cases that exist within enterprise IT environments.

## Main Premise

2A is built around the creation of a set of standardised templates that enable
easy, repeatable cluster deployments and life cycle management.

The main components of 2A include:

 * Hybrid Multi Cluster Management (HMC)

    Deployment and lifecycle managment of Kubernetes clusters, including configuration, updates, and other CRUD operations.

 * Cluster State Management (SMC)

    Installation and lifecycle management of [beach-head services](glossary.md#beach-head-services), policy, Kubernetes api configurations and more.

 * Observability (OBS)

    Cluster and beach-head services monitoring, events and log management.


## Quick Start

See the [2A Quick Start Guide](quick-start/2a-installation.md)

## Supported Providers

HMC leverages the Cluster API provider ecosystem, the following providers have
had ProviderTemplates created and validated, and more are in the works.

 * [AWS](quick-start/aws.md)
 * [Azure](quick-start/azure.md)
 * [vSphere](quick-start/vsphere.md)
