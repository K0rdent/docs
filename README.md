# Documentation Standards

By default, we follow the [Kubernetes documentation style guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/). 

## Header Capitalization

All header text should be capitalized.

## Referencing Kubernetes nested resources

Please use the dot notation.  So in the following:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
```

To refer to the `name` field, please use `.metadata.name` and not `name`.
